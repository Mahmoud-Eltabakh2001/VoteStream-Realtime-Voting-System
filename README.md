# VoteStream-Realtime-Voting-System
VoteStream is a real-time data pipeline project that simulates a live voting system using modern big data tools.  It demonstrates how to build a fully containerized, real-time streaming application that captures user votes, processes them on the fly, stores the aggregated results, and visualizes live analytics using Grafana.
